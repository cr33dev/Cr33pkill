My cats name is Mr pickles and he helps me by mashing the keyboard every 5 minutes
- I’m currently working on qualifications and my website and my silly little coding projects
- I’m currently learning Python, HTML, Django
- I’m looking for help with gaining a better understanding of python and web-design
